Dashboard Firmware

 Firmware for a custom dashboard implemented with an
 arduino-compatible microcontroller. Currently, it must be built and
 uploaded via the arduino ide. It relies on LibRCP as a submodule.

Usage

 Clone it directly into your sketchbook folder:

  $ cd ~/sketchbook
  $ git clone <repo>
  $ cd dashboard
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

 Launch the arduino ide, and choose "dashboard" from the
 sketchbook. Plug in the arduino, and upload the sketch.

Configuration

 Changes to the RCP channel configuration currently require updating
 the config in the source code and re-uploading the firmware.. See the
 declaration of CONFIG in dashboard.ino. Chanel constants are defined
 in "rcpparse.h".
